 * increase the small_allocation_rate_ratio by a factor 3
   this improves the efficiency without using much more memory

2002-12-05  Pierre-Etienne Moreau  <pem@escher.loria.fr>
 * do not activate statistics
 * improve the "freeze" mechanism: when a block contains many old objects
   (>TO_OLD_RATIO) the block can be promoted to the second generation only
   if does not contain any young object. To improve the efficiency of the
   GC we "freeze" these blocks: not further allocation can be done in the
   block. 
	
2002/10/31 <jong,olivierp@cwi.nl>
 * Blob size is now stored in a separate word instead of the header
 * Added test for writing blobs to binary string

2002/10/29 <vinju@loria.fr>
 * Removed old java ATerm library from this package.
   The java version is now located in the 'aterm-java' package.

2002/10/29 <jong@cwi.nl,olivierp@cwi.nl>
 * Added tests in ATmakeBlob and ATinsert to ensure blobs/lists stay
   within max. bounds

2002/09/23 <vinju@loria.fr>
* Fixed two bugs in the java library. 
  - Singletons did not match with [<term>,<list>].
  - Making [<term>,<list>] resulted in [<term>,[<list>]].  

2002/09/23 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * Fix dates in ChangeLog (October -> September)
 * Fix in ATwriteToString: print '<' and '>' around placeholders
 * Fix in writeToSharedString: terminate string buffer
 * Add to stress.c: assert that some reported failures work correctly

2002/09/18 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * Fix bug in read_term (blob data was not copied) reported by Tijs vd Storm

2002/09/17 <jong,olivierp@cwi.nl>
* Fixed two alignment bugs that only manifested themselves on sun:
  - 'data' field in Block was not eight byte aligned, we now moved it
    to the start of the structure to get the default platform alignment.
  - mark/mark_young: illegal optimization removed, term header dereference
    can only be done when you are sure it is a valid term so IS_MARKED must
    be delayed until after 'isValidTerm' check.

2002/09/12 <jong@cwi.nl>
* Fixed ~100 compiler errors due to the use of '//' as comment char,
  which (contrary to popular belief) *STILL* is not valid C !!!
  Several compilers (amongst which Sun's CC) complain and refuse to
  parse '//', even though gcc is willing to accept it.
  PLEASE REFRAIN FROM USING '//' AS COMMENT CHAR IN A C PROGRAM :-)

2002/09/11 <olivierp@cwi.nl>
* Merged GENGC version back into the main tree. Let's see how it holds out!

2002/08/08 <jong@cwi.nl>

2002/08/05 <olivierp@cwi.nl>
* Added AT_unmarkAll and AT_unmarkAllAFuns. These functions traverse
  the ATerm memory blocks instead of the actual ATerms. This can be
  more efficient when most of your terms are marked.
* Fixed efficiency problem of ATcalcUniqueSubterms: this function now
  takes time proportional to the number of unique nodes instead of the
  total number of nodes.

2002/07/02 <olivierp@cwi.nl>
* Improved hashing of ATprotectArray
* Fixed potential bug in tafio.c

2002-02-15  Pierre-Etienne Moreau  <pem@escher.loria.fr>

	* aterm/gc.c : new sweep phase
	  - at_freelist[size] is empty before being re-filled. 
	    this reduces fragmentation
	  - empty blocks are detected and recycled
	  - if at_freeblocklist_size becomes too large, the block is
	    removed from the block_table and deleted
	
	* aterm/memory.c: 
	  - add a at_freeblocklist and a at_freeblocklist_size
	  - reuse empty block when possible
	  - fix a bug in allocate_block: the last cell had a bad header

	* aterm/memory.h: block reduced to 2^12 instead of 2^16
