  * added definition for COMPILE in make_rules to get around a bug in
    automake

  * Improved dependencies and cleaning in toolbus/Makefile.am

2000/7/14 ({jong,olivierp}@cwi.nl)
  * relaxed ATerm parser to accept TB legacy constructs (:,?,$)
  * added tblog tool that can be used as a replacement for the old
    Tcl/Tk logger to log executed atoms to a file.
  * fixed handling of rec-monitor atoms by tifstoc

2000/7/12 ({jong,olivierp}@cwi.nl)
  * introduced subdir 'utils' with utility programs
  * added dicttoc program so constant terms and afuns can be placed in a 
    special '.dict' file.
	
2000/6/28 (jong@cwi.nl)
  * version is now 1.1
  * ToolBus-tools using the ATerm-library can now ATBpack() terms
    before sending them. This causes terms to travel over the TB
    in BAF-encoded form as a binary string.

2000/4/25 (olivierp@cwi.nl)
   * Version 1.0.1: fixed overflow bug in gc heuristics.
   * Fixed alignment bug in memory.c
	
2000/4/18 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * make dist no longer depends on the existence of ./toolbus/tifstoc

   * Added support for 64bits architecture.
     Use --with-64bit configure option to create the 64bit library.

   * Removed all asfix related stuff because the asfix library is now
     distributed separately (http://www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv)

2000/3/31 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * The toolbus is no longer required during the build process of the aterm
     library

2000/03/28 (mdejonge@cwi.nl)
   * no longer distribute reconf script
   * version is now 0.24
   * Added GPL license headers to the files in the distribution

	libraries.
   * Added an ATerm specific section to the INSTALL file.
