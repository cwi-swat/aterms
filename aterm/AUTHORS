The Annotated Term Library was developed at the CWI by
  Pieter Olivier <olivierp@cwi.nl>, and
  Hayco de Jong  <jong@cwi.nl>

The ATermTables were later re-implemented by Jan-Friso Groote

Currently, the library is maintained by
  Erik Scheffers (TU Eindhoven)
  Arnold Lankamp (CWI) 

Several people have contributed to the ATerm library by hinting
at bugs, sending in bugfixes, pointing out efficiency improvements,
or in general providing helpful comment: thanks!
