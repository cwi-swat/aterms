The Annotated Term Library was developed at the CWI by
  Pieter Olivier <olivierp@cwi.nl>, and
  Hayco de Jong  <jong@cwi.nl>

The ATermTables were later re-implemented by Jan-Friso Groote

Several people have contributed to the ATerm library by hinting
at bugs, sending in bugfixes, pointing out efficiency improvements,
or in general providing helpful comment: thanks!
