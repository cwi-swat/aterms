version 1.6.3
 * Compilation flag "-Werror" removed because newer gcc's (2.96.0)
   yield more warnings than we can find out at CWI with gcc 2.95.2
 * Several "vararg" tests are no longer built/tested as they cause
   problems on PPC architecures and they are no longer needed anyway.
 * Some print-statements dating back to the era before ATwarning are
   now directed through ATwarning for users who use their own error
   reporting routines.
 * New functions ATcompare and ATsort added
 * Package file "aterm.pkg" now distributed for use with the package
   base (http://www.cwi.nl/~mdejonge/package-base).

As of version 1.5.1 the ATerm Library is distributed under the LGPL
instead of the GPL license.
