The build process of the ATerm library is controlled by autoconf, automake,
and libtool (see www.gnu.org).

Before running ./configure to configure the system and to create Makefiles
from Makefile.in's, you should first run ./reconf which generates among
others Makefile.in's from Makefile.am's.

Running ./reconf might give several warnings about non-existent files which
can safely be ignored because automake will install these missing files for
you.

It is essential that you have up-to-date versions of automake and libtool.
-Version 1.4 or above is required for automake
-Version 1.3.4 or above is required for libtool

Note for CWI developers. Adding "automake" to your ~/.pkgrc file
in order to use the latest versions of automake and libtool.
