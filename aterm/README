=============================================

This library implements the ATerm datatype as described in ...
This distribution also contains a first draft of a paper describing
the ATerm datatype and its implementation in this library.

The ATerm library needs GNU-make in order to compile correctly.
You can retrieve the latest version of GNU-make from your closes
GNU mirror. In the Netherlands for instance, you could try:

Installation should be a matter of simply configuring and making:
./configure --prefix <installation directory, i.e. /usr/local>
gmake
gmake install

Miscellaneous remarks for old ToolBus or aterm-lib users

- tifstoc is the new aterm version of the old ctif.
  This to avoid clashes with ctif in the ToolBus distribution.
