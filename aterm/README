***NOTE on COMPILER OPTIMIZATIONS:

  (added Wed, 16 Jan 2002, <jong@cwi.nl>)

Due to several pending issues with the optimizer in the GNU C Compiler
(most noticable to everyone using gcc version over 2.95), we strongly
advise AGAINST passing gcc any of its '-O' optimization flags.

More information on GCC optimization bugs can be found at:
  http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl?database=gcc&cmd=query

and subsequently selecting the Category:
  "optimization -- Issues related to optimization"

As a result, the default configuration of the ATerm Library does not
pass any optimizer flags to gcc anymore. Should you wish to experiment
with specific compiler flags anyway, you can use the "--with-cflags"
configure option. Your mileage may vary from the stress-test failing,
to coredumps and spontaneous aborts in your program.




README with this version of the aterm library.
==============================================

The ATerm library needs GNU-make in order to compile correctly.
You can retrieve the latest version of GNU-make from your closes
GNU mirror. In the Netherlands for instance, you could try:
ftp://ftp.nl.net/pub/gnu.

Installation should be a matter of simply configuring and making:
./configure --prefix <installation directory, e.g. /usr/local>
gmake
gmake install

If you have any questions, find any problems or are missing some
features in this library, please let us know. You can contact us at:
