README with this version of the aterm library.
==============================================

The ATerm library needs GNU-make in order to compile correctly.
You can retrieve the latest version of GNU-make from your closes
GNU mirror. In the Netherlands for instance, you could try:
ftp://ftp.nl.net/pub/gnu.

Installation should be a matter of simply configuring and making:
./configure --prefix <installation directory, e.g. /usr/local>
gmake
gmake install

If you have any questions, find any problems or are missing some
