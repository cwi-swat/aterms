Parse Tree Support

This package contains libraries and tools for two parse tree formats:

1. AsFix2   - the parse tree format for SDF2
2. AsFix2ME - the parse tree format for SDF2, with flattened lexicals and 
              layout as used in the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment.

The larger parts of these libraries have been generated automatically by our 
tool called 'apigen'. 


Installation Instructions
=========================

1) Required packages.

   -GNU make, available from:
      www.gnu.org

   See the file ./package for the dependencies

2) Configuring Parse Tree Support.

   Assuming that all dependencies are available in your PATH, then
   the following command will configure Parse Tree Support accordingly: 

    ./configure --prefix=<pt-support>

   Note. Default behaviour of configure is that it will look for libraries               in <prefix>/lib and for executables in your search paths. So,                   you do not need to specify the locations of all these packages                  explicitly.

   If you use gcc, sglr is built with "gcc -Wall -g -O2". If you prefer
   different options use --with-cflags="<options>" when you run configure.

   ./configure --help gives a detailed list of configuration options.    

3) Building Parse Tree Support.

   Assuming that GNU make is called "gmake" on your system then the
   following commands will build and install Parse Tree Support:

   gmake
   gmake install

4) Checking Parse Tree Support.

   Parse Tree Support can be tested via:

   gmake check
