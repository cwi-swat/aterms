	* moved "static ATerm get_elt(ATerm tree)" to a more logical
	position in the file

	* added "int ATbbtreeCompare(ATermBBTree tree1, ATermBBTree tree2,
	ATermComparator comparator)", which implements a ATermComparator
	function for trees (making it easy to have sets of sets of ...)

	* added "ATbool ATbbtreeIsEmpty(ATermBBTree t)" for test on
	emptiness

	* added "int ATbbtreeSize(ATermBBTree t)", a wrapper around the
	internal get_count() function.

	* moved "ATbool ATbbtreeIsTree(ATerm tree)" to a more logical
	place in the file

	* eliminated a few elt_compare() calls in ATbbtreeGet() for
	possibly increased performance
	(this should be done at a few other places as well)

	* Added a "ATerm ATbbtreeGetAny(ATermBBTree tree)" function for
	retrieving a 'non-deterministically chosen' element from a set
