
The Java ATerm Library was developed at CWI and LORIA-INRIA by
  Hayco de Jong         <jong@cwi.nl>,
  Pierre-Etienne Moreau <Pierre-Etienne.Moreau@loria.fr>,
  Pieter Olivier        <olivierp@cwi.nl>, and 
  Jurgen Vinju          <jurgenv@cwi.nl>


Several people have contributed to the ATerm library by hinting
at bugs, sending in bugfixes, pointing out efficiency improvements,
or in general providing helpful comment: thanks!
