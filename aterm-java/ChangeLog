  * aterm/pure/PureFactory.java: 
    - initialize ATermImpl and create prototypes	

  * aterm/pure/ATermImpl.java: 
    - make factory a protected static slot	
    - add static initialize and getStaticFactory functions
	
  * aterm/pure/ATermApplImpl.java: 
    - introduce make(...) functions
    - make hashFunction a protected function
	
  * aterm/pure/AFunImpl.java: 
    - initHashCode added
    - hashFunction added

  * aterm/pure/ATermIntImpl.java: 
    - initHashCode added
    - hashFunction added	

  * aterm/pure/ATermListImpl.java: 
    - initHashCode added
    - hashFunction added	

  * aterm/pure/ATermApplImpl.java: 
    - initHashCode added
    - init makes a copy of the array
    - hashFunction added
    - serialize added

  * aterm/pure/PureFactory.java: use a new hashing mechanism
    - hashCode is computed in each ATerm implementation
    - no array allocation is needed to compute the hashCode

  * Added ugly config script in order to detect the location of this 
    package easily in the meta package.
  * Configure.in automatically detects location of shared-objects.jar in
    order to get distcheck correct.
  * Added test subdirectory to SUBDIRS
  * Made tests that were in the test directory all active
  * Fiddled with order of directories in SUBDIRS in order to get
    distcheck correct.

  * aterm/pure/ATermListImpl.java: 
    - fix a bug in match:	
      makelist().match(<list>) should return the empty ATermList	

  * aterm/ATermFactory.java: 
  * aterm/pure/PureFactory.java: 
    - makeAppl(AFun fun, ATermList args) has been renamed into
      makeApplList(AFun fun, ATermList args) to avoid ambiguities
      The semantic should not depend on the static type
      Aterm     l1 = makeList(...)	 
      AtermList l2 = makeList(...), with l1==l2	 
      makeAppl(fun,l1) should be equal to makeAppl(fun,l2)

  * aterm/pure/PureFactory.java: 
    - modify hashAppl for reducing hashing-collisions 
    - introduce hashApplNoCopy for avoiding copy of arrays
    - introduce static arrays for reducing allocations
