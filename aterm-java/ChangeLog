  * aterm/pure/ATermListImpl.java: fix a bug in reverse()

2002-12-09   <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
  * Bumped to 1.1beta
  * Changed code according to new SharedObject interface
  
2002-11-20    <vinju@loria.fr>
  * Bugfix in list matching code.
  
2002-11-19    <{moreau,vinju}@loria.fr>
  * fixed a bug: make("[<term>,<list>]",1,[]) should return "[1]" 
    instead of "[1,[]]"
  * working towards: Release 1.0

2002-11-06  Pierre-Etienne Moreau  <pem@escher.loria.fr>

  * aterm/pure/ATermApplImpl.java:
    - small modifitions in the hashing function
    - make(AFun,ATerm[],ATermList) is now a protected function 
    
2002-11-04    <pem@bach>
  * aterm/pure/PureFactory.java: 
    - initialize ATermImpl and create prototypes	
  * aterm/pure/ATermImpl.java: 
    - make factory a protected static slot	
    - add static initialize and getStaticFactory functions
  * aterm/pure/ATermApplImpl.java: 
    - introduce make(...) functions
    - make hashFunction a protected function
  * aterm/pure/AFunImpl.java: 
    - initHashCode added
    - hashFunction added	
    

2002-10-31  <pem@escher.loria.fr>
  * aterm/pure/ATermIntImpl.java: 
    - initHashCode added
    - hashFunction added	
  * aterm/pure/ATermListImpl.java: 
    - initHashCode added
    - hashFunction added	
  * aterm/pure/ATermApplImpl.java: 
    - initHashCode added
    - init makes a copy of the array
    - hashFunction added
    - serialize added
  * aterm/pure/PureFactory.java: use a new hashing mechanism
    - hashCode is computed in each ATerm implementation
    - no array allocation is needed to compute the hashCode

2002-10-29    <vinju@loria.fr>
  * Added (ugly) config script in order to detect the location of this 
    package easily in the meta package.
  * Configure.in automatically detects location of shared-objects.jar in
    order to get distcheck correct.
  * Added test subdirectory to SUBDIRS
  * Made tests that were in the test directory all active
  * Fiddled with order of directories in SUBDIRS in order to get
    distcheck correct.

2002-10-20    <pem@bach>
  * aterm/pure/ATermListImpl.java: 
    - fix a bug in match:	
      makelist().match(<list>) should return the empty ATermList	
  * aterm/ATermFactory.java: 
  * aterm/pure/PureFactory.java: 
    - makeAppl(AFun fun, ATermList args) has been renamed into
      makeApplList(AFun fun, ATermList args) to avoid ambiguities
      The semantic should not depend on the static type
      Aterm     l1 = makeList(...)	 
      AtermList l2 = makeList(...), with l1==l2	 
      makeAppl(fun,l1) should be equal to makeAppl(fun,l2)	
	
2002-10-19    <pem@bach>
  * aterm/pure/PureFactory.java: 
    - modify hashAppl for reducing hashing-collisions 
    - introduce hashApplNoCopy for avoiding copy of arrays
    - introduce static arrays for reducing allocations

2002-10-?? <{jong,olivierp}@cwi.nl>
    - Made separate package for java ATerm library
    - Refactored design to use shared-object-factory
