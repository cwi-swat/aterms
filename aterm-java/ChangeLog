	* maintain annotations when tranforming an ATerm

2004-08-06  Antoine Reilles  <tonio@bonzai>

	* aterm/pure/SingletonFactory.java: if you need a singleton PureFactory...

2004-04-08  pem  <pem@polly.loria.fr>

 * aterm/pure/PureFactory.java: make the parseId function compatible with the C version of the ATerm library

$Id$

Tue Feb 10 15:27:49 CET 2004 <m336@cwi.nl>
 * upgrade auto* to: autoconf 2.59, automake 1.7.9, libtool 1.5.2

2004/01/30 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Bumped to 1.6
 * Compliant with automake-1.6

2003/09/26 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Release 1.5

Wed Aug 27 14:20:42 CEST 2003 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * version bump to 1.5beta
 * make empty list notion private to PureFactory
 * remove any static references to 'empty'
 * throw away aterm-java-*.pkg in CLEAN_FILES, not *.pkg, as this includes
   the repository-managed source file for generating .pkg files!

2003/08/14 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Made all constructors of ATerm implementations protected.
 * Made init and initHashCode methods also protected.
 
2003/08/13 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Removed getStaticFactory methods and static references to factories to make
   use of multiple factories possible again. 
 * Added local references to factory and constructors to initialize the
   factory. The factory is not initialized in the init method to prevent
   unnecessary copying of the factory reference.

2003/08/12 <{pem@loria.fr>
 * Added the getEmpty() function which returns the empty element of a list
 * getEmpty and insert are used in ATermListImpl (instead of getPureFactory())
   This makes generic function usable with apigen 
 
2003/08/12 <{jong,kooiker}@cwi.nl>
 * aterm/Visitor.java: scrapped folding

2003/08/07 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Removed old commented out code
 * All classed use PureFactory.getEmpty() instead of PureFactory.empty now to
   improve reusability of ATermListImpl
 * Visibility of empty is still 'protected' for backward compatibility
 * Made internal class ATermWriter a toplevel class
   
2003/08/07 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Made aterm.pure.ATermListImpl public such that it can be inherited from.
 * Changed visibitity of init functions of ATermListImpl in order to be able to
   use them in classes that extend ATermListImpl.
 * Bumped to 1.4

2003/08/01 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Set dependency on version 1.4.2 of JJTraveler
 * Set version to 1.3.2

2003/07/17 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Set dependency on version 1.4.1 of JJTraveler
 * Release 1.3.1

2003/07/02 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Release 1.3

2003/06/26 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Added package definition file

2003-05-15 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Changed getId() to getUniqueIdentifier() (also for setId)
 * Bumped to 1.3beta

2003-05-15 <Julien.Guyon@loria.fr>
 * Add identifiable interface (with getId) to ATerm
 * AtermImpl implements SharedObjectWithId
 * Now each ATerm has a unique identifier

2003-04-23 julien Guyon <julien.guyon@loria.fr>
 * Release 1.2

2003-03-30 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Used backquotes to delay calling *-config scripts to after
   configure phase. Otherwise autobundle can't configure all packages
   before building them.
 * Changed --with-jjtraveler to --with-JJTraveler because autobundle
   demands that.

2003-03-18 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Use shared-objects-config script to obtain last version of 
   shared-objects
 * aterm-java-config script now prints the classpath needed to
   USE aterm-java, including the shared-objects and JJTraveler jar files.
 * Added normal dependency on JJTraveler package

Mon Mar 17 10:13:11 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * Major hack to fix unexpected dependency on jjtraveler:
   As long as jjtraveler.jar is in aterm-java, it needs to
   be installed as well, or other packages break: ToolBus
   needs aterm-java (and by transitivity apparently it needs
   jjtraveler as well) to build tifstojava
 
2003-03-14 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Bumped to 1.2beta
 * Removed specialized visitor package from aterm implementation
 * Made aterm implementation depend on and use the JJTraveler package
 * TODO: make real dependency on jjtraveler package instead of jar inclusion
 
Tue Feb 25 16:16:51 CET 2003 <jong@cwi.nl>
 * Removed unused fields,variables and methods as reported by Eclipse

2003-01-22    <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
  * Release 1.1 under LGPL

2002-12-21    <pem@bach>
  * aterm/pure/ATermListImpl.java: fix a bug in reverse()

2002-12-09   <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
  * Bumped to 1.1beta
  * Changed code according to new SharedObject interface
  
2002-11-20    <vinju@loria.fr>
  * Bugfix in list matching code.
  
2002-11-19    <{moreau,vinju}@loria.fr>
  * fixed a bug: make("[<term>,<list>]",1,[]) should return "[1]" 
    instead of "[1,[]]"
  * working towards: Release 1.0

2002-11-06  Pierre-Etienne Moreau  <pem@escher.loria.fr>

  * aterm/pure/ATermApplImpl.java:
    - small modifitions in the hashing function
    - make(AFun,ATerm[],ATermList) is now a protected function 
    
2002-11-04    <pem@bach>
  * aterm/pure/PureFactory.java: 
    - initialize ATermImpl and create prototypes	
  * aterm/pure/ATermImpl.java: 
    - make factory a protected static slot	
    - add static initialize and getStaticFactory functions
  * aterm/pure/ATermApplImpl.java: 
    - introduce make(...) functions
    - make hashFunction a protected function
  * aterm/pure/AFunImpl.java: 
    - initHashCode added
    - hashFunction added	
    

2002-10-31  <pem@escher.loria.fr>
  * aterm/pure/ATermIntImpl.java: 
    - initHashCode added
    - hashFunction added	
  * aterm/pure/ATermListImpl.java: 
    - initHashCode added
    - hashFunction added	
  * aterm/pure/ATermApplImpl.java: 
    - initHashCode added
    - init makes a copy of the array
    - hashFunction added
    - serialize added
  * aterm/pure/PureFactory.java: use a new hashing mechanism
    - hashCode is computed in each ATerm implementation
    - no array allocation is needed to compute the hashCode

2002-10-29    <vinju@loria.fr>
  * Added (ugly) config script in order to detect the location of this 
    package easily in the meta package.
  * Configure.in automatically detects location of shared-objects.jar in
    order to get distcheck correct.
  * Added test subdirectory to SUBDIRS
  * Made tests that were in the test directory all active
  * Fiddled with order of directories in SUBDIRS in order to get
    distcheck correct.

2002-10-20    <pem@bach>
  * aterm/pure/ATermListImpl.java: 
    - fix a bug in match:	
      makelist().match(<list>) should return the empty ATermList	
  * aterm/ATermFactory.java: 
  * aterm/pure/PureFactory.java: 
    - makeAppl(AFun fun, ATermList args) has been renamed into
      makeApplList(AFun fun, ATermList args) to avoid ambiguities
      The semantic should not depend on the static type
      Aterm     l1 = makeList(...)	 
      AtermList l2 = makeList(...), with l1==l2	 
      makeAppl(fun,l1) should be equal to makeAppl(fun,l2)	
	
2002-10-19    <pem@bach>
  * aterm/pure/PureFactory.java: 
    - modify hashAppl for reducing hashing-collisions 
    - introduce hashApplNoCopy for avoiding copy of arrays
    - introduce static arrays for reducing allocations

2002-10-?? <{jong,olivierp}@cwi.nl>
    - Made separate package for java ATerm library
    - Refactored design to use shared-object-factory
