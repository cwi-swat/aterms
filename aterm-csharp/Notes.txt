Suggestions:
Uses Enum type for ATerm types INT, REAL, BLOB etc. (see Aterm.cs)

InputStream -> System.IO.Stream
InputOutputStream -> System.IO.Stream

Questions:
-How to define constants? e.g. static byte START_OF_SHARED_TEXT_FILE = (byte)'!'; in ATermFactory.java


- fillInStackTrace?? (Fwd.cs)

-WeakReference.clear() -> <obj>.Target = null
-ByteArrayoutputStream -> MemoryStream?
-String.valueOf -> ToString
-PrintStream -> StreamWriter
- lock  private ATerm parseFromReader(ATermReader reader) // throws IOException 
   what does "lock" mean in PureFactory?
-Why are constructors of Impl classes protected? How can they get instantiated in PureFactory?
 Idem for AtermList.init and initHashCode functions
-ATermVisitableImpl implements ATerm.Visiatable, not JJTraveler.IVisitable.
   Why then, is accept method not declared in ATermVisitableImpl?
   
   
- Is serialize in ATermApplImple overriding a Java method? What is corresponding C# 


- Made names of visitors aterm-specific: 
   Visitor -> ATermVisitor
   Visitable -> ATermVisitable
   Fwd -> ATerm Fwd
