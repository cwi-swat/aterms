Both versions:
* Extend adt formalism with separated lists
* Extend adt formalism with support for aterm annotations like:
  annotation(posinfo, Area) which declares that the annotation with
  label posinfo has type Area. Normal adt entries can then be used to
  define the Area type. Every sort should receive a hasAttributePosInfo
  or something. Note that this implies an explosion of functions in 
  case there are several annotations...
* Use lex/yacc for a readable less abstract version of the adt formalism...

C version:


Java version:

* builtin integer arguments should appear as 'int' not 'Integer' in the
  make functions
