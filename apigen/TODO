Both versions:
* generate subpackage for each sort
* do not generate empty class and impl-class, just the impl class
* Extend adt formalism with support for aterm annotations like:
  annotation(posinfo, Area) which declares that the annotation with
  label posinfo has type Area. Normal adt entries can then be used to
  define the Area type. Every sort should receive a hasAttributePosInfo
  or something. Note that this implies an explosion of functions in 
  case there are several annotations...
* Use lex/yacc/javacc for a readable less abstract version of the adt formalism...
* support list of builtin types

C version:


Java version:
* make reverse and concat for normal lists
