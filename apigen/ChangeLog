2001/03/26 ({jong,olivierp}@cwi.nl)
 * added initial adt-to-java support
 * version 0.8.1

2001/03/02 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * change == to = in shell-scripts to check string-equality

2001/02/28 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * apigen classes are now built before the utils directory is entered
 * several references to ${top_srcdir} changed to ${top_builddir}
   to fix problems revealed by the build-script (mainly CLASSPATH related)

2001/02/27 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * Version 0.8
 * Several fixes to prepare apigen for a dailybuild regime
 * apigen succesfully handles "gmake clean all check install distcheck"
 * added `-t | --no-timestamp' option to adt-to-c; should reduce CVS
   conflicts when generated adts are put under CVS' control.

2001/02/20 (markvdb@cwi.nl)
 * Bug fixed in specification which removes the constructor annotations
   from the productions.

2001/02/19 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * version 0.7.3
 * The use of prologue files is now optional in adt-to-c. If no prologue
   file is specified, no special prologue code is generated.
 * test/rolotest and test/booltest no longer have (a zero byte) prologue
 * removed test/rolodex.pro and test/Booleans.pro
 * fixed output of usage() in utils/adt-to-c (conforming to new behaviour)
 * silenced output of test/rolotest (new visit/acceptor code was verbose)
 * added ChangeLog entry for Jurgen's fix to his changes of 2001/01/16
 * utils/ADT.adt and utils/ADT.pro added to EXTRA_DIST
 * spec/Sdf2-to-ADT.trm.tbl added to EXTRA_DIST so external users don't
   need pgen to build apigen.
 * configure.in adapted to inform users that pgen is for developers only

2001/02/19 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * adapted test/booltest to conform to the new functions generated for
   the bottomsorts (see immediately below)

2001/02/16 (jurgenv@cwi.nl)
 * removed generation of bottomsorts Lexical, Separator and Layout and
    replaced them by generating lex(<name(str)>), sep(<name(str)>) and 
    w(<name(str)>).  

2001/02/16 ({jong,olivierp}@cwi.nl)
 * Added prefix to the front of visitor names
 * patched ChangeLog entry date

2001/02/16 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * utils/adt-to-c rewritten, option handling is now the same as in
    sdf2-to-adt, so be sure to check "adt-to-c --help" before using
    it!
 * test/Makefile.am now uses the appropriate switches in both sdf2-to-adt
    and adt-to-c calls to avoid {classpath,binary,script}-location confusion.
 * utils/Makefile.am uses the appropriate switches in adt-to-adt

2001/02/15 ({jong,olivierp}@cwi.nl)
 * Added support for basic types: int (int), real (double), str (char *)
 * Added support for sort specific visitors

2001/02/15 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * Version 0.7.1
 * --verbose in sdf2-to-adt was called --VERBOSE (fixed)
 * added -g, --generator option to sdf2-to-adt which overrides default
    location of compiled apigen-specification
 * Added -l <FILE> option to sdf2-to-adt which overrides default location
    of labeling equations.
 * The -h option now shows the default locations of the APIGEN parsetable
     and the labeling equations.

2001/02/14 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * sdf2-to-adt script enhanced to conform to mainstream options
    (-i, --input, -o, --output to specify input/output files)

2001/02/08 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * utils/sdf2-to-adt rewritten: uses temporary files and does proper cleanup
    upon exit. Several flags added, amongst which is -t to specify location
    of the parsetable used by the script.
 * utils/sdf2-to-adt is now more robust: the exit code of each substep is
    checked and the script refuses to continue after encountering errors
    Replaced the redundant "unparse-'hack function symbol'-reparse" fase
    by adding more support in the specification.

2001/02/08 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * Added reflexive ADT to access adt's (creates: libADT.a)
 * sdf directory removed entirely
 * configuration improved (using AC_PACKAGE_REQUIRE)
 * dependency on xt tools removed
 * labeling now done by asf-evaluator (implemented using traversals)
 * directories test and doc re-activated, tests work again

2000/09/27 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * Version 0.6
 * Fixed capitalization bug in build-valid-c-afun's
 * Relaxed syntax in C-FILE-NAME to allow `-'
 * Any existing `-' characters are stripped in the prefix,
    this fixes a bug where '-' characters where passed all the way
    through to C functionnames (where they are illegal)

2000/09/20 (jong@cwi.nl)
 * removed capitalization of FieldId's in build-valid-c-afun

 * Fields now have a prefix and an id ("wsAfter", "openBracket").
 * Updated tests to reflect recent changes in specification.

2000/09/08 (jong@cwi.nl)

 * test/Makefile.am used obsolete 'apigen' instead of 'gen-c-api'
 * fixed dependency problem in check target
 * Updated SDF_FILES in spec/Makefile.am to reflect recent changes
    in specification structure.
